Noise Shader Library for Unity shader graph
==============================

This library inspired by another [noisy library](https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/Noisy-Nodes/tree/master/NoiseShader) but has (will have) additional noise functions (mostly 4D variants)

Includes subgraph nodes for each type of noise, an hlsl file with noise functions, and an example scene

### Roadmap
- [X] Simple noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
- [X] "Perlin" noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
- [ ] Simplex noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
- [ ] Voronoi noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
