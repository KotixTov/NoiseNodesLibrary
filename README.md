Noise Shader Library for Unity shader graph
==============================

This librari inspired by another [noisy library](https://github.com/JimmyCushnie/Noisy-Nodes/tree/master/NoiseShader) but has (will have) additional noise functions (mostly 4D variants) 

### Roadmap
    -[x] Simple noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
    -[x] "Perlin" noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
    -[] Simplex noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
    -[] Voronoi noise (1D/2D/3D/4D)
